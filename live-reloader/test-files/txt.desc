// We have to have a ticker
// Extract file paths
// Do iteration through
// Inside the visit function, create a
// goroutine for each path, so inside the
// goroutine, get file contents hash them then
// update our concurrent hashmap
// And inside a concurrent hashmap, add a ticker
// for an interval of 1 second
// Have a channel for where the changed file's path will
// be seant
// Then spawn a different goroutine just notifying the changes

This is a goroutine
